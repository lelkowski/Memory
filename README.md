# Memory Game
Memory or Matching games are games that require players to match similar elements. Participants need to find a match for a word, picture, or card. For example, students place 30 word cards; composed of 15 pairs, face down in random order. Each person turns over two cards at a time, with the goal of turning over a matching pair, by using their memory.

# Why coding?
I've always liked games, computers and technology, so by going with "Do what you'll love, and you'll never work another day in your life." I choose to learn how to code.
